Exponential Distribution
Formula:
  PDF: f(x; λ) = λ * e^(-λx), for x ≥ 0
  Mean: μ = 1 / λ
  Variance: σ² = 1 / λ²

Solution:
  What is the chance a machine breaks down within the next 3 hours?
  λ = 1/5 (mean = 5 hours)
  P(T ≤ 3) = 1 - e^(-3/5) ≈ 0.4512 (45.1%)

Normal Distribution
Formula:
  PDF: f(x; μ, σ) = (1 / (σ√(2π))) * e^(- (x - μ)² / (2σ²))
  Mean: μ
  Variance: σ²

Solution:
  Percent of workers finishing in under 40 mins (μ=45, σ=5)
  Z = (40 - 45) / 5 = -1
  P(Z ≤ -1) ≈ 0.1587 (15.9%)

Poisson Distribution
Formula:
  PMF: P(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!
  Mean: μ = λ
  Variance: σ² = λ

Solution:
  Probability of 3 defects (λ = 2)
  P(X = 3) ≈ 0.1804 (18.0%)

Binomial Distribution
Formula:
  PMF: P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)
  Mean: μ = np
  Variance: σ² = np(1 - p)

Solution:
  90 pass out of 100 with p = 0.95
  μ = 95, σ ≈ 2.18, Z = -2.29
  P ≈ 0.0109 (1.1%)

Triangular Distribution
Formula:
  PDF varies by x (see earlier definition)
  Mean: μ = (a + b + c) / 3
  Variance: σ² = (a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc) / 18

Solution:
  Troubleshooting time: a=10, b=20, c=45
  Mean = 25 minutes

Lognormal Distribution
Formula:
  PDF: f(x; μ, σ) = (1 / (xσ√(2π))) * e^(- (ln(x) - μ)² / (2σ²))
  Mean: μ' = e^(μ + σ² / 2)
  Variance: σ'² = (e^(σ²) - 1) * e^(2μ + σ²)

Solution:
  P(T > 3) when ln(time) ~ N(1, 0.5)
  Z = 0.197 → P ≈ 0.422 (42.2%)

Gamma Distribution
Formula:
  PDF: f(x; k, θ) = (x^(k - 1) * e^(-x/θ)) / (θ^k * Γ(k))
  Mean: μ = kθ
  Variance: σ² = kθ²

Solution:
  Shape=3, θ=10 → mean = 30
  P(T > 30) ≈ 0.26 (26%)

Beta Distribution
Formula:
  PDF: f(x; α, β) = (x^(α - 1) * (1 - x)^(β - 1)) / B(α, β)
  Mean: μ = α / (α + β)
  Variance: σ² = (αβ) / ((α + β)² * (α + β + 1))

Solution:
  α = 4, β = 2 → Mean = 0.667 (66.7%)

Weibull Distribution
Formula:
  PDF: f(x; λ, k) = (k / λ) * (x / λ)^(k - 1) * e^(-(x / λ)^k)
  Mean: μ = λ * Γ(1 + 1/k)
  Variance: σ² = λ² * [Γ(1 + 2/k) - (Γ(1 + 1/k))²]

Solution:
  k = 2, λ = 1000 → Mean ≈ 886 hours

Uniform Distribution
Formula:
  PDF: f(x) = 1 / (b - a), for a ≤ x ≤ b
  Mean: μ = (a + b) / 2
  Variance: σ² = (b - a)² / 12

Solution:
  1 out of 10 workers gets high-priority task → P = 0.1 (10%)
